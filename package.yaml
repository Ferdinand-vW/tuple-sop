# Metadata used when publishing your package
synopsis:            Exports various functions that manipulate n-ary tuples. This library uses generics-sop
                     to create a generic representation of n-ary product types. To regain type inference, the exported functions
                     work only on tuples with at most 10 components.

# To avoid duplicated efforts in documentation and dealing with the
# complications of embedding Haddock markup inside cabal files, it is
# common to point users to the README.md file.
